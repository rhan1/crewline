# crewline

A drop-in Claude Code setup that gives you:

1. **A multi-row statusline** showing Claude context, rate-limits (5h + 7d with absolute reset clocks), cache savings, cost, plus dedicated rows for Codex and Gemini dispatch activity. Rate limits use **cross-session reconciliation** (every open session converges on one shared number instead of each showing its own stale snapshot); the Codex row shows **real Codex rate-limit windows** (fetched in the background from `codex app-server`, falling back to a dispatch-count estimate when unavailable); executor rows show a live **`running now`** badge while a dispatch or interactive TUI session is in flight; and a **`bg-claude`** indicator surfaces background `claude -p` jobs that are otherwise invisible to the 5h bar.
2. **Slash commands** that force-dispatch work to Codex or Gemini, budget-check a plan before committing to execution, schedule plans for the next rate-limit window, and show a live view of native subagents (`/agents`). Dispatch wrappers snapshot the working tree around every call and report exactly which files the executor wrote (`[Mutation]` in the log, `mutated`/`mutation_action` in the JSON) — set `CODEX_EXPECT_READONLY=1` to have a nominally read-only run undo its own writes, which is refused if the tree was already dirty. They also carry a built-in **watchdog** (background 60s poll — kills and notifies on stalled or overtime runs, no GNU `timeout` needed) and record honest statuses (`timeout` / `stalled` / `empty` / `suspect`) with a `status_detail` field instead of trusting exit-code success.
3. **Hooks** that warn you before a heavy turn blows the 5h window, tell you when to *spend* surplus budget that would otherwise expire (and when to pull back), rotate dispatch logs weekly, and (optionally) log native-subagent lifecycle for the `/agents` monitor.

The core idea: keep Claude (Opus / Sonnet) on judgment, debugging, smoke-testing, and architecture. Delegate mechanical code generation and long-context / multi-modal work to Codex and Gemini — they're cheaper, sometimes faster, and each has a capability profile the other can't match.

## Example statusline

```
Opus 4.7 (1M context) | [████░░░░░░] 38% | [██░░░░░░░░] 5h:20% (4h 52m - 05:01) | [█████▉░░░░] 7d:59% (3d 13h - 13:09) | cache:82% (saved $4.21) | $31.32 | 2797m | @yourname
codex plus · gpt-5.4 | [█▋░░░░] 7d:27% (5d 21h - 16:49) | 42.1k toks (5h) | last: scraper-api · 6.2k toks · 2m ago · 47s
gemini pro · 3.1-pro-preview | [▌░░░░░] 2/~100 · 8.4k chars (5h) | last: summarize-log · 4.1k chars · 12m ago · 18s
```

Rows 2 and 3 only render when Codex / Gemini are installed. First row always renders.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** — [download](https://claude.com/claude-code) (required; this is a Claude Code add-on)
- **jq** — `brew install jq` (statusline uses it to parse Claude Code's stdin JSON)
- **Node.js** ≥ 18 — for the two hooks (`brew install node` or nvm)
- **Python 3** — for the dispatch wrappers' JSON helpers (preinstalled on macOS)

**Optional but recommended:**
- **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** — `brew install codex` — enables Codex dispatches and the Codex statusline row. Requires a ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Enterprise subscription.
- **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** — `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` then `gemini` to OAuth — enables Gemini dispatches and the Gemini statusline row. Free tier works; Pro recommended for larger contexts.

The statusline degrades gracefully — if `codex` or `gemini` isn't installed, those rows simply don't render.

**Platform:** Built on macOS (uses BSD `date -j` syntax and `stat -f "%m"`). Should work on Linux with `date -d` / `stat -c "%Y"` tweaks — PRs welcome.

## Install

Quickest path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhan1/crewline.git
cd crewline
./install.sh
```

The installer:
1. Prompts once per optional component — accept the default (Y) to match the author's setup, or decline to skip. Pass `--all` to skip prompts and install everything, or `--minimal` to install only the statusline.
2. Backs up any existing `~/.claude/statusline.sh`, `~/.claude/scripts/`, `~/.claude/commands/`, and `~/.claude/hooks/` targets to `~/.claude/backups/pre-install-<ts>/`
3. Symlinks this repo's files into `~/.claude/` (so `git pull` upgrades everything)
4. Prints the settings.json snippet for only the components you installed

**Manual install** — if you'd rather see what's going on:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/{scripts,commands,hooks}
cp statusline.sh ~/.claude/statusline.sh
cp scripts/*.sh ~/.claude/scripts/
cp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
cp hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline.sh ~/.claude/scripts/*.sh
```

Then merge `examples/settings.json` into `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Slash commands

Once installed and the settings.json snippet is merged, these are available via the Claude Code skill picker or by typing `/<name>`:

| Command | When to use |
|---|---|
| `/dispatch <model_id> <task>` | Dispatch to any model in the registry — e.g. `/dispatch codex <task>`, `/dispatch qwen <task>` |
| `/dispatch-codex <task>` | Shortcut for `/dispatch codex` — Codex for mechanical code gen, CRUD scaffolds, pattern-following |
| `/dispatch-gemini <task>` | Shortcut for `/dispatch gemini` — Gemini for long-context (>150k tokens), multi-modal, parallel-batch |
| `/budget-check <plan>` | Pre-flight: does this plan fit in the remaining 5h window? Returns ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ with concrete options |
| `/execute-at-reset <plan>` | Schedule a plan to auto-execute ~1 min after the next 5h reset (via Claude Code's `CronCreate`) |
| `/burn` | Burn-rate posture: is there surplus 5h budget that will expire unused, or should you conserve? Reports SPRINT / SPEND / NORMAL / CONSERVE / CRITICAL |
| `/agents` | Live view of native Claude subagents (Agent/Task tool) — running vs done, each one's task, duration, and a completion count. Reads the subagent transcripts Claude Code maintains, so it works across sessions and even when rate-limited |
| `/balance` | Cross-provider budget health: scores Claude / Codex / Gemini together and says who should take the next job. See **Cross-provider balancing** below |

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `burn-rate-advisor.js` | `UserPromptSubmit` + `PreToolUse (Agent\|Workflow)` | Grades **budget left vs clock left** (`surplus = budget_left% − clock_left%`). 5h budget does not roll over, so when the window is about to reset with a lot unspent it says **SPRINT** — fan out to maximum useful width, breadth over depth, push mechanical work to external CLI executors. When burning faster than the clock it says **CONSERVE**/**CRITICAL** — sequential, cheapest tier, checkpoint and chain to the next window. **Silent when on pace**, and silent at the fan-out decision point unless the posture is actionable. A high 7d reading tempers or cancels a sprint, since the weekly window does not refill. |
| `auto-budget-check.js` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Scans each prompt for execution-intent keywords (execute, implement, deploy, refactor…). If matched AND 5h usage ≥40%, injects a `[auto-budget]` advisory into the context so Claude sees it before starting. Escalates to 🚨 at ≥80%. |
| `weekly-maintenance.js` | `SessionStart` | Once per 7 days, rotates dispatch logs older than 30 days and refreshes the Gemini model cache. Runs in background (`child.unref()`) so session startup is never blocked. |
| `ruflo-model-enforcer.js` | `PreToolUse` (Agent) | Optional. See below. |
| `agy-router.js` | `PreToolUse` (Agent) | Optional. Pushes eligible subagent work onto Antigravity (Gemini) instead of a Claude tier, so it bills the provider you are *not* exhausting. See **Cross-provider balancing** below. |

## Cross-provider balancing

RuFlo answers "which Claude tier?" These two answer the question one level up: **which provider should do this at all?**

### `/balance` and `scripts/quota-balance.mjs`

Reads every provider's quota cache in one place — Claude 5h + 7d, Codex weekly, Gemini/agy 5h + weekly — and scores each on a single signed number:

```
surplus = (% budget left) − (% of window still to come)
```

Positive means you are underspending and that budget expires unused at reset. Negative means you are outrunning the refill and will strand yourself mid-week.

Two rules fall out of it, and both exist because of a real failure: one provider hit **100% used with 4.6 days left to reset** while another sat at 0.3% used the entire time.

- **Floor rule** — never drain a provider below ~15% while more than ~40% of its window remains. Flags `⚠ FLOOR`.
- **Use it or lose it** — a provider in `SPEND` state whose reset is under 24h away should be leaned on hard, not conserved. Applies per provider, not just to the 5h window.

Capability still decides who *can* do a job (no browser driving on agy, no VPN-gated DB from a sandboxed executor). Among those that can, surplus decides who *should*.

### `agy-router.js` + `agents/agy-worker.md`

Unconditional rules like "mechanical work goes to executor X" are what drain a single provider dry. This pair makes the choice conditional and automatic.

`agy-router.js` classifies each `Agent` call and, when the profile is clearly Gemini-eligible, advises routing to the `agy-worker` subagent instead of a Claude tier. Eligible: codebase exploration and file-reading research, mechanical code, batch work, long-context reads, test generation, first-pass drafts. Disqualified: browser driving, VPN/credential-gated data work, MCP-tool tasks, security judgment, anything interactive, and very short asks where writing the spec costs more than doing the work.

`agents/agy-worker.md` is a thin dispatcher subagent: it specs the task, dispatches via `gemini-dispatch.sh`, liveness-checks the log, and — critically — **verifies the deliverable exists and parses before reporting success.** Antigravity has a documented failure mode where it returns a detailed, confident success narrative for a file it never wrote, so "it said it worked" is not evidence.

**Dispatch threshold.** The common ">60 lines" heuristic assumes you are trading one paid quota for another. When the target provider's quota is effectively free, the only cost is spec-writing plus verification, so the threshold drops: dispatch when **the spec is shorter than the work** — roughly 30+ lines of output, 3+ files to read, or any repeated/batch task. Exploration almost always qualifies, since one sentence of spec buys a large pile of reading.

Disable either with `AGY_ROUTER_OFF=1`.

### Model and effort selection

`gemini-dispatch.sh` accepts `AGY_MODEL` and `AGY_EFFORT` (`low|medium|high`, default `high`). Run the strongest tier when the quota is idle — down-tiering a budget you never exhaust saves nothing and only costs quality.

One sharp edge: `--effort` is **rejected** for models with built-in thinking (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6-thinking`). Passing it kills the dispatch in ~5s with no output, which is indistinguishable from a silent no-op. The wrapper suppresses `--effort` for `claude-*` and `gpt-*` models for exactly that reason.

`agy models` lists what your account can reach. Notably it may include Claude-family models — Claude-quality output billed to the Gemini pool.

### Picking a model: measure, don't assume

A worked example, because the intuitive answer was wrong twice.

A first pass had Gemini 3.7 fail one task where 3.6 passed, which looked like a clear regression. It wasn't reproducible. A powered rerun — 6 trials x 4 tasks x both models, 48 cells — put both at **24/24 correct and 168/180 (93%) on beyond-spec robustness stress cases**, statistically indistinguishable. The single failure never recurred across 30 further attempts.

Two methodology rules came out of it:

1. **n=1 is not a verdict.** Run at least 3 trials before recording any model comparison.
2. **Give the incumbent equal attempts.** The challenger had been run 4x and the incumbent once, so "the incumbent is perfect" was equally unsupported.

And a third, about the instrument itself: measure quality separately from correctness. A pass/fail grader scores a solution that scrapes through a 5s gate identically to one finishing in 0.2s, and scores one that happens to survive the specified cases identically to one that also handles input nobody mentioned. `quality_probe.py` adds perf headroom, beyond-spec robustness, and structural craft signals for exactly that reason.

### RuFlo (model routing)

`hooks/ruflo-model-enforcer.js` fires on every `Agent` tool call and rewrites the `model` parameter to the cheapest tier that fits the task. It uses keyword heuristics — no external CLI, no network calls, no LLM inference. The whole thing is ~120 lines of Node.js with no dependencies.

**How it works:** the hook scores the agent's `description` field against three keyword lists (haiku / sonnet / opus). Longer descriptions get a small complexity boost toward opus. When the winning tier beats a 0.5 confidence threshold, the hook either confirms the chosen model (AGREE) or swaps it (REWRITE). Below threshold it passes through without touching anything.

**Writes:** `~/.claude/hooks/ruflo-last-route.txt` — a one-line record of the last routing decision, consumed by the statusline. `~/.claude/hooks/ruflo-enforcer.log` — append-only log of every firing.

**Tuning:** the keyword lists are at the top of `hooks/ruflo-model-enforcer.js` in a `KEYWORDS` object. Add or remove terms to match your own usage patterns. The length thresholds (200 / 400 chars) are also in the same block.

The installer prompts before installing this hook. To add it later, copy or symlink `hooks/ruflo-model-enforcer.js` to `~/.claude/hooks/` and add the `PreToolUse` block from `examples/settings.json`.

## Statusline

Writes `~/.claude/.session-state.json` on every tick (every ~10s). This file is the ground truth for `/budget-check`, `/execute-at-reset`, and `auto-budget-check.js` — the statusline is the only component that actually sees Claude Code's rate-limit data, so it mirrors it into a file the other components can read.

### Customization

Environment variables (set in your shell profile):

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CODEX_DISPATCH_CAP_5H` | `50` | Messages-per-5h cap used for the Codex usage bar. ChatGPT Plus is typically 20–100 on GPT-5; pick the midpoint or tune to your actual plan. |
| `GEMINI_DISPATCH_CAP_5H` | `100` | Same idea for Gemini. Free tier has lower effective caps — tune down if you see the bar peg at 100%. |
| `GEMINI_DISPATCH_MODEL` | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | The model the Gemini dispatch wrapper forces via `-m`. If you don't have Pro, set this to `gemini-2.0-flash` or another model your account can access. |

To change the statusline colors, the gradient is defined in `pct_color()` near the top — green → yellow → red by default.

## Model registry

`~/.claude/orchestrator-models.json` is the single source of truth for the statusline and `/dispatch`. The install wizard writes it; you can also edit it by hand.

### Schema

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "models": [
    {
      "id":             "qwen",
      "display_name":   "qwen 2.5",
      "model_label":    "72b-instruct",
      "command":        "qwen",
      "args_template":  "run {prompt_file}",
      "rate_limit_5h":  200,
      "color":          "#e05c2a",
      "last_file":      "~/.claude/qwen-last.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Unique key. Used for log file naming and `/dispatch <id>`. |
| `command` | yes | The CLI binary name (must be on `$PATH`). |
| `args_template` | yes | Command arguments. `{prompt_file}` is replaced with the spec file path. `{output_file}` is available for CLIs that write output to a file rather than stdout. |
| `last_file` | yes | Path where the dispatcher writes the last-run JSON (`~` is expanded). Statusline reads this. |
| `display_name` | no | Label shown in the statusline. Defaults to `id`. |
| `model_label` | no | Model version shown next to the display name. |
| `rate_limit_5h` | no | Dispatch cap per 5-hour rolling window — used for the usage bar. Omit if you don't want a bar. |
| `color` | no | `#rrggbb` hex color for the statusline row label. Defaults to white. |

### Adding a model without re-running install

1. Open `~/.claude/orchestrator-models.json`.
2. Append an entry to the `models` array following the schema above.
3. Restart Claude Code (or wait for the next statusline tick).

No hook changes or script installs needed — the generic dispatcher `~/.claude/scripts/llm-dispatch.sh` handles all models in the registry.

### Example: `llm` (Simon Willison's LLM CLI)

```json
{
  "id":            "llm",
  "display_name":  "llm",
  "model_label":   "claude-3-haiku",
  "command":       "llm",
  "args_template": "prompt -m claude-3-haiku < {prompt_file}",
  "rate_limit_5h": 500,
  "color":         "#3db8f5",
  "last_file":     "~/.claude/llm-last.json"
}
```

Then dispatch with: `/dispatch llm <task description>`

## When to use what

Routing heuristics the author has settled on after ~6 weeks of daily use:

| Task profile | Executor |
|---|---|
| Judgment, debugging, architecture, security, ambiguous scope | **Claude** (don't delegate) |
| Mechanical code, ~60+ lines, mirroring an existing file's style | `/dispatch codex` (default) |
| Input > ~150k tokens (summarize log, analyze whole repo, big PDF) | `/dispatch gemini` |
| Multi-modal input (images, screenshots, PDFs, video) | `/dispatch gemini` (Codex CLI is text-only) |
| 5+ similar mechanical sub-tasks in parallel | `/dispatch gemini` (Pro tier has more headroom than Codex Plus) |
| Any other registered CLI model | `/dispatch <model_id>` |
| Small edit (<30 lines) | **Claude direct** (dispatch overhead exceeds gain) |

Codex and Gemini have rough quality parity on code generation. The bottleneck is usually spec precision and your smoke-test discipline, not the model.

## Caveats

- **Multi-modal Gemini dispatches** must stage attachments inside the project directory (or `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/`). Files outside those paths silently fail, and Gemini may hallucinate from the prompt description. Add `.gemini-tmp/` to your project's `.gitignore` if you go this route.
- **Rate-limit resets are rolling, not scheduled.** Claude Code's `resets_at` is an approximation; the statusline advances it by the window size if it's stale, so your countdown won't lie even when the source timestamp has drifted.
- **The budget-check heuristics** (~2M tokens per 5h, ~8k per small edit, etc.) are eyeballed — tune them for your own plan tier by editing `commands/budget-check.md`.
